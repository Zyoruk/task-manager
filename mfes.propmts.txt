This sounds like a solid plan for breaking down your application into microfrontends! Here's a breakdown of your proposed structure and some considerations for each:

1. tm-core-app (API DOM, State Management, Base Components)

Responsibilities:

API DOM: This is an interesting concept! It suggests you want a centralized way to manage interactions with your backend APIs. This could involve:
Abstracting API calls into reusable functions.
Handling common error scenarios and responses.
Potentially caching data for performance.
State Management: Choose a state management solution that suits your needs and scales well with microfrontends. Popular options include:
Redux: A robust and widely-used library, but can be more verbose.
Zustand: A lightweight and simpler alternative.
Recoil: Facebook's state management library designed for React.
Base Components:
Authentication: Handle user login, logout, and session management.
Error Page: Display a user-friendly error message for various scenarios.
Layout: Provide a consistent structure (header, footer, navigation) across microfrontends.
Considerations:

Technology: Select a framework/library that aligns with your team's expertise (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
Communication: Define how tm-core-app will communicate with other microfrontends (e.g., props drilling, custom events, a shared state management solution).
2. tm-tasks-app (Task Board)

Responsibilities:

Fetch task data from the tm-tasks-api.
Implement the Kanban board UI with drag-and-drop functionality.
Update task states (pending, in progress, completed) via API calls.
Considerations:

Kanban Library: Explore existing Kanban board libraries (e.g., React Beautiful DnD, BoardView) to accelerate development.
Data Synchronization: Ensure the task board reflects real-time updates from the API and other potential users.
3. tm-notifications-app (Toast Notifications)

Responsibilities:

Establish a WebSocket connection to your Kong server.
Handle incoming notification messages.
Display toast notifications to the user.
Considerations:

WebSocket Library: Use a suitable WebSocket library for your chosen framework (e.g., Socket.IO, SockJS).
Notification Library: Consider using a toast notification library (e.g., React Toastify, Snotify) for a polished look and feel.
4. tm-dashboard-app (Metrics Dashboard)

Responsibilities:

Retrieve metrics data from the tm-metrics-api.
Visualize the data using charts, graphs, and other suitable components.
Considerations:

Charting Library: Choose a charting library that meets your visualization requirements (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, D3.js).
Data Refresh: Implement a strategy for refreshing the dashboard data (e.g., polling, WebSockets).
General Microfrontend Considerations:

Microfrontend Framework: Consider using a microfrontend framework (e.g., single-spa, Piral, Luigi) to help manage the integration and orchestration of your microfrontends.
Communication: Establish clear communication patterns between microfrontends (e.g., custom events, shared state).
Independent Deployability: Design your microfrontends to be independently deployable to maximize agility.
Styling Isolation: Prevent CSS conflicts between microfrontends using techniques like CSS Modules, styled-components, or CSS scoping.

----------------
This is a great tech stack for building microfrontends! Here's how your chosen technologies align with your microfrontend architecture and some additional considerations:

Nx (Nrwl Extensions)

Benefits for Microfrontends:
Monorepo Management: Nx excels at managing monorepos, making it ideal for housing multiple microfrontend applications within a single codebase. This promotes code sharing, consistency, and easier refactoring.
Dependency Management: Nx helps manage dependencies between your microfrontends, ensuring version compatibility and reducing potential conflicts.
Build Optimization: Nx's build system can optimize builds for each microfrontend, improving performance and reducing bundle sizes.
Code Generation: Nx can generate boilerplate code for new microfrontends, components, and services, speeding up development.
Angular

A Natural Fit: Angular's component-based architecture and modularity make it well-suited for building microfrontends.
Module Federation (Webpack 5):
Dynamic Loading: Module Federation allows your microfrontends to load and share code dynamically at runtime, enabling independent deployments and updates.
Shared Dependencies: You can share common Angular modules (e.g., components, services) between microfrontends to reduce code duplication and maintain consistency.
State Management (NgRx or Alternatives)

NgRx (Redux for Angular):

Centralized State: NgRx provides a centralized store for managing your application state, which can be beneficial for sharing data and synchronizing state changes between microfrontends.
Scalability: NgRx is designed to scale well for large and complex applications.
Learning Curve: NgRx has a steeper learning curve compared to simpler state management solutions.
Alternatives to Consider:

Zustand: A lightweight and simpler state management library that can be a good fit if you prefer a less opinionated approach.
RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript): Angular already uses RxJS extensively. You can leverage its powerful observables and operators for state management without introducing a dedicated library.
Specific Recommendations for Your Architecture

tm-core-app (API DOM, State Management, Base Components):

API DOM: Create Angular services within tm-core-app to encapsulate your API interactions. You can use Angular's HttpClient for making requests and RxJS for handling asynchronous operations.
State Management:
If you anticipate complex state interactions between microfrontends or need the robust features of NgRx, use it for centralized state management.
If you prefer a simpler approach, consider Zustand or leverage RxJS for state management within tm-core-app.
Base Components: Implement your authentication, error page, and layout components as Angular components within tm-core-app.
tm-tasks-app, tm-notifications-app, tm-dashboard-app:

Module Federation: Configure these as separate Angular applications within your Nx monorepo, using Module Federation to load them dynamically into your main application shell.
Communication:
Shared State (NgRx/Zustand): If using a centralized state management solution, these microfrontends can directly interact with the shared state.
Custom Events: For more loosely coupled communication, use custom events to communicate between microfrontends.
Styling Isolation: Employ CSS Modules or a similar technique to prevent style conflicts.
Additional Tips:

Start Small: Begin by migrating one microfrontend at a time to gradually introduce Module Federation.
Communication Strategy: Define a clear communication strategy between your microfrontends early on to avoid complexity later.
Testing: Implement thorough unit and integration tests for your microfrontends to ensure they function correctly independently and when integrated.
This setup leverages the strengths of Nx, Angular, and Module Federation to create a robust and scalable microfrontend architecture. Remember to prioritize clear communication, independent deployments, and a well-defined state management strategy for success!
